Submission for the Zenefits internship assignment. Zenefits online portal is an Angular web app with backend in Express.js ([Github repo](https://github.com/YashJipkate/zenefits-backend)). Some salient features of this app are:

 - Uses customized [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/orgchart)'s Oranization chart to build the org chart.
 - Shows all the companies associated with the Auth token in an attractive carousel.
 - Shows all the departments associated with the Auth token in the carousel.
 - Social (Google and Email) authentication using Auth0 integration.
 - Code base follows best practices.
